|-------------|------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Discount applied after order reaches threshold | When the user has ordered more that the discount threshold the 10% discount will be applied to their order | When the user orders over the threshold 10% of the cost id added to the order | In bag/context.py change grand_total = total + discountto grand_total = total - discount |
| The user creates an order and the total price is displayed | Match the users orders with the model to get the price of items | The fuction returned just the category id | I used category_item = Category.objects.all().values() to retrieve all valuse from the model |
