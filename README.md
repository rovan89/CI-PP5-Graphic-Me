## Bugs
<hr>

| **Feature / Function** | **Expected Result** | **Actual Result** | **Action** |
|-------------|------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Discount applied after order reaches threshold | When the user has ordered more that the discount threshold the 10% discount will be applied to their order | When the user orders over the threshold 10% of the cost id added to the order | In bag/context.py change grand_total = total + discountto grand_total = total - discount |
| The user creates an order and the total price is displayed | Match the users orders with the model to get the price of items | The fuction returned just the category id | I used category_item = Category.objects.all().values() to retrieve all valuse from the model |
| Checkout Success | When a user completes a payment the bag is empty and the total is 0 | The price of all items order by the user paid or not would be in the grand total | Created an if statment in the template to check is the paid var was False | 
| Remove Item From Bag | When the user clicks the remove item it would remove the item and redirect them back to the bag page | The item is removed but the user is not redirected  | Change the return to render bag.html |
| Footer Navigation | The navigation redirects the user to the correct page | The home, portfolio and order urls don't direct the user to the page | Create {% url '' %} path for each  |
| Depolyed Website | The website is fully functional, live and accessable to all on the internt | When the url is searched a Error 500 is returned  | Change psygopg2 to version 2.8.6 |
